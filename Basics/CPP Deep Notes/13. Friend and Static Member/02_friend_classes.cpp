/*
Friend classes : Above there is a class called My and has only one data member which is private and is a.
Another class called your exists which takes an object of class My and public, (has a relationship)
Upon object m created in Your class publicly no data member can be accessed, that's why we make the class your as friend.

To allow one class to access private members of another class upon object then we make class Your as friend of class My.

This concept is useful in container classes. Your has an object of class m so Your class is container of objects of My class.
So, in container classes if we want to access private or protected members then what we do is we declare them as friend
inside those classes.
