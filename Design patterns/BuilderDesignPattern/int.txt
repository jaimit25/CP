Defination : Used when we are developing complex Object or many Configuration Object.

Example : 
We have House (super class)
	House has Rooms, Doors, Interior. (Common between Every house) (Sub class)
		(House can be - Igloo , Wood , Cement (Not common things))
			Igloo - can have multiple configurations 

[so for the sub class there are different configurations which is needed to be done] ie for house of type igloo interior would be different, door would be different etc.
